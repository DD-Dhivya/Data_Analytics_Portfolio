This project utilizes VBA code to prompt users for numeric input and assign values based on predefined categories:

1 → Division

2 → Category

3 → Total

If the user enters any number other than 1, 2, or 3, an alert appears indicating an invalid value and asks if they want to try again. If the user selects "Yes", the prompt reappears, allowing them to enter a valid input.

This VBA automation ensures correct categorization and improves user experience by handling invalid inputs efficiently
